There are three JUnit test files:
1. AccountTest.java          contains test cases for Account.java
2. AuthenticatorTest.java    contains test cases for Authenticator.java
3. UtilitiesTest.java        contains test cases for Utilities.java

The AccountTest.java test file is in the application folder because Account.java contains protected methods. Therefore, they must be in the same package.
